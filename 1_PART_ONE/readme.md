# P1 - PART ONE: Basics

### Introduction to Python and Jupyter for its application to Collaborative Chemoinformatics Open Platform (CHEMO)

The "Collaborative Chemoinformatics Open Platform" (CHEMO) course is an autonomous learning platform aimed at students and researchers interested in the development of biocomputing tools, from Python, which is the most widely used programming language. With advances in omic sciences and new technologies, it has become necessary to acquire computer skills applied to science and the management of biological databases.

Welcome to the introduction of the course CHEMO, in the first part you will find the fundamentals to understand the Python programming language, it is focused on the manipulation, extraction and analysis of data from biological databases (omics) , starting from the basic concepts of programming and its applications, with examples based on manipulation of DNA sequences.


## Contents
In this first *Python_basic* Jupyter notebook you will learn:
    
1. Introduction to Python
2. Variables
3. Types of data
4. Types of arrangements
5. Upload files
6. String manipulation
7. Practice 1: Expression of genetic material
8. Flow control structures
9. Practice 2: Expression of genetic material
10. Functions
11. Practice 3: Proteins and amino acids


## Learning outcomes
It is expected that by the end of this notebook the user will be able to:

1. Understand the basics of the Python programming language.
2. Understand variable formats:
    - What are they?
    - The assignments
    - The basic operations
3. Understand the uses and types of data:
    - Numerical
    - Boolean

    - Arrangements
4. Identify the types of arrangements and their use:
    - Lists
    - Tuples
    - Sets
    - Dictionaries
5. Load and modify files in different formats and sizes, view them, analyze them, read and write over them.
6. Manage basic flow control structures:
    - Conditionals
    - Iterations
7. Understand the Python tools that can be used in biology.

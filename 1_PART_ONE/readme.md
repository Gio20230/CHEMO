# P1 - PART ONE: Basics

### Introduction to Python and Jupyter for its application to Collaborative Chemoinformatics Open Platform (CHEMO)

The "Collaborative Chemoinformatics Open Platform" (CHEMO) course is an autonomous learning platform aimed at students and researchers interested in the development of biocomputing tools, from Python, which is the most widely used programming language. With advances in omic sciences and new technologies, it has become necessary to acquire computer skills applied to science and the management of biological databases.

Welcome to the introduction of the course CHEMO, in the first part you will find the fundamentals to understand the Python programming language, it is focused on the manipulation, extraction and analysis of data from biological databases (omics) , starting from the basic concepts of programming and its applications, with examples based on manipulation of DNA sequences.

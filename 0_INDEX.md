# PART ONE: Basics

## Introduction to Data Science with Python

- Python as a programming language
- Jupyter as an open resource developer

## Python Basics

- Introduction to file manipulation
- Strings
- Expressions
- Conditional statements
- Using and building functions
- Cycles and iterations

Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

- Managing dates and time

### What do we need?

You can use our notebooks locally by cloning the repositoyry or downloading it for the website

1. Option 1: Downloading it as zip archive and unzipping it

   Option 2: Cloning it to your computer using the package `git`
```console
git clone https://github.com/ramirezlab/DS-for-DD.git
```

2. Use the Anaconda software for a clean package version management

Install Anaconda3: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

3. Use the package management system conda to create an environment (DS_for_DD). We provide an environment file (yml file) containing all required packages
```console
conda env create --name DS_for_DS -file=env_DS_for_DS.yml
```

4.  Activate the conda environment
```console
conda activate DS_for_DS
```
Now you can work within the conda environment.

5. Start the Jupyter notebook.

```console
jupyter notebook
```

> Now you can get started with your first notebook. Enjoy!
